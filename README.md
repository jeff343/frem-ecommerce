## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This was the most DOM manipulation I have done with vamilla javascript, and I enjoyed trying new things to make the funtions work.

### Continued development

I would like to work on writing cleaner code, as I feel the site started to get a little messy.
