### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Wokring on this project I was a good refresher on DOM manipulation using vanilla Javascript. Designing the page to get as close to the mockup as possible was a good challenge and allowed me to work on my basic css.

### Continued development

I enjoyed developing the page with html/css/javascript, but I would like to keep learning how to use different libraries and frameworks.
